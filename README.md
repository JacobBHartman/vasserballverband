13th Day of December, 2018
One of the greatest lessons I learned was to make an MVP. I ought to never forget this lesson and yet I continuous shoot too high too soon. Therefore, I will make a concerted effort to keep-it-simple-stupid early and often while making this project. For an MVP, I should get a site live locally. The site should be a Top 10 app of 12U, 14U, 16U and 18U boys water polo teams in Southern California.

The site should use Python, Django, Postgres, HTML+CSS+JS on AWS and Apache.

I should focus on the Django and Postgres up-front.
