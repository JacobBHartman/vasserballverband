# vasserballverband

An API platform for water polo.

[The API](http://www.wasserballver.band/api)

[Example app](http://www.wasserballver.band)



The API provides the following models...
* `Authority`: the legal entity in charge of a team, institution, or facility
* `City`: a locality, either a city, town, CDP or other (United States focused)
* `Finish`: the end finish for a team within a tournament or series
* `State`: one of the 50 United States of America. Could be generalized to `Subcountry`
* `Team`: A water polo team
* `Tournament`: A series or tournament of water polo games`
* Future: `Game`: an individual match of water polo
* Future: `People`: Including players, coaches, administrators, officials, etc.
* Future: `City`, `State`, and `County` could be condensed to `Place`.
* Future: `Pool`: A water polo pool

Examples of applications you could build...
- Top 10 lists for NCAA, High School, Club, etc.
- Best in State, Best in County, Best in City
- Best Cities for Water Polo based on their Club and High School Finishes plus the number of universities they have
- A Pool Cost comparison chart
- Water Polo Wiki
- Club-Administration-as-a-Service
