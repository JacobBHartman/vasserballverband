Quickly start a water polo team with as little maintenance and initial capital as possible!

Generate over $40,000 in revenue working 20 hours a week in your free time while improving your community.

Perfect for coaches, referees, college athletes, motivated parents, and others. Many people love to teach and coach but do not have an avenue that fairly compensates them for their precious time and hardwork. Also, coaches have fairly little control over who they coach and how they coach.

A coach who is working a lot at a low-end club is doing
3-8 practices hours a practice week
48 practice weeks a year
8-24 game hours a tournament weekend
6-18 tournaments a year
At a pay of $11-22 an hour
11*((3*48)+(8*6))=$2,112 a year or $176 a month
15*((6*48)+(12*12))=$6,480 a year or $540 a month
22*((8*48)+(12*18))=$11,616 a year or $968 a month
Some coaches could easily get 1600+ a month if they coach two practice time slots

Work the same hours you would get but get paid possibly $35,000 a year
