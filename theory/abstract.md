# The Problem

### The United States of America
The United States of America (USA or US) is the 3rd largest country on Earth by area[?] and is estimated to have a population of roughly 328,000,000 people as of January 2019[?]. It also had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $62,518 per capita by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Population and GDP per capita ought to give us a rough idea of the degree to which a country has time for recreation, specifically sport. As expected, the United States has won 2,827[?] combined medals in both the Summer and Winter games whereas the runner-up to this record, the old Soviet Union, had won 1,204[?]. Even after taking into account the unique position of the US after World War II, it is still astonishing its dominance in international sport, though not random. The US is dominant because it lies at the center of a Venn diagram in which the interlocking circles of (1) a large population and (2) a first-world market-oriented economy. Countries such as Sweden or Australia are market-oriented but not necessarily populous. Countries such as China or Indonesia are populous but have only recently market-oriented policies. None of this is to say that the US overperforms, in fact it probably underperforms when compared to a country such as Australia who has a population that is 1/13th that of the US but has a medal county that is 1/5th of the US.

It is expected that a prosperous and populous country with diverse people would be able to support the organization of hundreds of sports, this is in fact true for the US. However, we will see that the average American participation in sport is reserved for youth and pales in comparision to that of other first-world countries. Some sports will be more popular than others and a reasonable guess would follow the Pareto Principle where 20% of sports garner 80% of participation and/or revenues. And yet the remaining 20% of the population (which in the US would equal roughly 66 million people) has the opportunity to play many fringe sports. Roughly 70% of the population is 54 years old or younger.

USA Water Polo (USAWP) stated in its 2017 annual report that it had 45,320 members which is footnoted "total 12 month individual members", possibly meaning that these were not all entirely annual memberships. This means out of the 223 million Americans under the age of 55, roughly .01974 % of the population had a USAWP membership or 1 out of 5000.

# Reasons for The Problem

### The Waterfall of Olympic Authority
USA Water Polo (USAWP) is a monopoly. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is itself an obvious monopoly. It is a power/money-seeking corporation that has motivations outside of its public goals, including but not limited to advertising revenue from the worlds largest brands as well as power and prestige for its stakeholders. Deriving authority from IOC is the US Olympic Committee (USOC) which has large discretion in putting together the US teams for each and every possible sport. Now, of course the USOC doesn’t train its own athletes, that would be too deep and broad of a goal for any organization to handle, especially a bureaucracy. The sports of archery and water polo have very little need to band together in any capacity as their markets and requirements for organization so vastly differ. Therefore, the USOC picks individual organizations to field the teams for their respective sports. One can imagine that if the US were to have many different youth soccer organizations, that whichever one gets picked to be run the olympic team would have an advantage in attracting talent and funding due to their elevated status. This is true for water polo and I imagine is true for most other sports in the US as well.

### Varsity Sports
The US has the unique issue of high schools and colleges competing for talent, resources, and facilities that would otherwise go to clubs. Some sports have completely bypassed the issue by going independent and becoming the primary recruiting grounds as opposed to the high school field. High school sports are nothing but a way to represent your hometown for many athletes, their journey to athletic success is in the club pipeline. It is preferable that academics and athletics separate wherever they were being forced together (I entertain the idea that colleges would still have teams without the federal endorsement of the slave plantation known as the NCAA. The good news is that club water polo could grow drastically in spite of varsity teams.

### US Franchise System
Most Americans are familiar with the four major professional sports leagues in the States. What they might not have thought about is how the four major pro sports leagues are unique in that they essentially follow the expansion-franchise model of league organization. The leagues have the ultimate decision in which teams are added and have voting power on where teams are located.

### NFL Revenue Model
Additionally, these four leagues compose the five highest revenue generating leagues in the world. In 2017 the NFL generated $8.1 billion which is evenly distributed amongst its 32 teams ($255 million each). In addition to this, teams are able to generate local revenue. For example, the Green Bay Packers generated an additional $199 million in local income. In spite of pulling in roughly $454,000,000, the Packers had an operating profit of $34,100,000. Many teams (Packers may or may not be included) have their stadiums greatly subsidized by local taxpayers. One can imagine team owners being buddy-buddy with the executives of their advertisers, local and state officials as well as all of the other elite-types you can imagine: academia, Hollywood, etc.

# Precendents for a Solution

### Bottom-up Athletic Progression versus Top-down Funding and Programmes
Why are Americans so good at basketball? One of the reasons is that little kids have easy access to basketball courts all over the country where they can play without coaches, parents, or administrators forcing them to do so nor interfering with actual play. This results in a nationwide autonomous organic training programme with zero oversight. Additionally, organized basketball is managed by a cornucopia of authorities: friend groups, sports academies, camps, clinic, the NCAA, high school, religious institutions, youth leagues, workplace leagues, city leagues, professional, semi-professional, amateur leagues, international play (olympic pipeline).

### The European Club System and Germany Specifically


### The Netherlands
The Netherlands has a land area of 13,086 square miles with a 2019 population of 17,283,008 which comes out to a population density of 1,078 people per square mile. The urban areas and population of Southern California are on the same order of magnitude as those of the Netherlands.

4.5 million of the 16 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country which comes out to an average of 129 athletes per club. Surely Pareto's principle applies to a certain extent and one could guesstimate that there are a few super clubs and many, many more small-time institutions. Two-thirds of the population older than 15 years participates in sports on a weekly basis. Dutch

To imagine what my hometown of Murrieta, California would look like if 2/3 of the adults played sports weekly is impossible. People would be thinner. Community would be stronger. Life skills and overall well-being would be improved. The community of Avalon on Catalina Island could probably support 6-12 different sports clubs and possibly 2 dueling soccer teams! Imagine the local pride that could be generated with a strong community institution in which a large percentage of the city is involved.

Pay for athletes could support a college education. It can also provide another avenue for a broader portion to get paid for being good at sports. The Spanish Tercera Division (4th level has an average salary of 300-1000 euros) and it Segunda B (3rd level) can make 2000-3000 euros.

# The solution
Taking advantage of school districts, schools, state, county, local officials, colleges,

# California

### A focus on California
California is the epicenter of water polo within the United States. There are roughly [25 college varsity programs](http://www.waterpoloplanet.com/water-polo-planet/looking-for-a-college-team-in-usa/mens-college-teams/), roughly [34 community college programs](http://www.cccaasports.org/sports/mwaterpolo/index). USA Water Polo (USAWP) splits the country into 11 separate zones, 5 of them are in California. There are possibly many college club programs in the numerous large state universities. Finally, high school water polo is common throughout the state (though not entirely) and is administered by the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) and its 10 Sections.

### A focus on Southern California
Northern California and Southern California might as well be their own states with respect to water polo as each area has their respective colleges, USAWP zones, and CIF sections. Southern California is incredibly dense if one recognizes that the bulk of the populations of Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties live in an area that is roughly 7,400 square miles. This area was roughly calculated as follows: draw a line from where San Diego's urban areas blend into rural, up through to the foothills of Mount San Jacinto, curving around the foothills of Big Bear, Mt San Antonio, north of Santa Clarita, and heading west following the mountain range to Santa Barbara.  A population of at least 18,000,000. Additionally, the drive time from the Tijuana border to the far end of Santa Barbara proper is only a 3.75 hour drive.
		
# The Solution and Action Plan
Taking advantage of school districts, schools, state, county, local officials, colleges,

	The goal is to build a club system of water polo that is built from the bottom up.
The structure of a water polo club for which I am seeking already exists.
