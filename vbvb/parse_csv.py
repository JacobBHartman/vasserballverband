'''
    Run within Python shell after running 'python3 manage.py shell'

    This Python script will convert comma-separated-values (.csv) files, each of which corresponds to a model in the application programming interface (API).

    Its first task is to rename .csv files downloaded from the public Google Sheets
    spreadsheet into a sanitized .csv file that mimics its corresponding models name.

    Its second task is to open each file and write objects one-by-one to the database. Files have to be opened and used to populate the database in a specific order. That specific order is in order of dependence. Least dependent models are populated first, most dependent models are populated last

    It would be nice if there were a program that automatically wrote models from .csv files but I guess that is another project in itself.
